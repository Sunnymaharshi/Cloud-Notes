Your application is now receiving intermittent 5xx and 429 HTTP responses from the Cloud Storage
JSON API as the demand escalates. You want to decrease the failed responses from the Cloud Storage API.
	Limit the upload rate from your application clients so that the dormant bucket's peak request rate is reached more
	gradually. 

Your application is controlled by a managed instance group. You want to share a large read-only data set between all the instances in the managed instance group. You want to ensure that each instance can start quickly and can access the data set via its filesystem with very low latency. You also want to minimize the total cost of the solution.
	Move the data to a Compute Engine persistent disk, and attach the disk in read-only mode to multiple Compute Engine
	virtual machine instances.
