        IAM Roles vs Resource Based Policies
            When u(user,application or service) assume a role, u giveup ur original permissions and 
            take permissions assigned to the role 
            When using a resource based policy, the principal doesn't have to giveup any permissions
        IAM Permission Boundaries
            supported for users and roles (not groups)
            allows u to set max permissions an IAM entity can get 
        IAM Access Analyzer
            to find which resources are shared externally
            define Zone of Trust (AWS Acc or AWS Org)

            Policy Generation 
                generates policy based on access activity
                CloudTrail logs is reviewed to generate policy with fine-grained permissions and 
                appropriate actions and services 
                reviews CloudTrail logs upto 90 days 
        STS (Security Token Service)
            to assume a role 
            define IAM Role within ur acc or cross-acc 
            define which principals can access this Role 
            Use STS to retrieve credentials and 
            impersonate the IAM Role u have access to (AssumeRole API)            
            temporary credentials can be valid between 15min to 12hrs
            can revoke active sessions and credentials for a role by adding policy 
            using a time statement - AWSRevokeOlderSessions 
            For granting access to 3rd party 
                3rd party AWS Acc ID 
                An External ID (secret btw u and 3rd party)
                    to uniquely associate the role btw u and 3rd party
                    must be provided when difining the trust and when assuming the role 
                    must be choosen by 3rd party
            Session Tags 
                tags that u pass when u assume a role 
                to have condition in policy 
            AssumeRole API
                access a role within ur account or cross-account 
            AssumeRoleWithSAML API 
                return credentials for user logged with SAML 
            AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API 
                return credentials for user logged with IdP
                ex: Amazon Congnito, login with amazon, facebook, goolge or any OpenID Connect 
                AWS recommends to use Cognito Instead
            GetSessionToken API 
                for MFA, from a user or AWS account root user 
            GetFederationToken API 
                obtain temporary credentials for fred user, 
                usually a proxy app that give the creds to distributed app inside a corporate network 
        Identity Federation 
            give users outside of AWS permissions to access AWS resources in ur account 
            from Identity Providers
                SAML 2.0 
                Custom Identity Broker 
                Web Identity Federation with(out) AWS Cognito
                Single Sign-On (SSO)
            SAML 2.0 Federation
                Security Assertion Markup language 2.0 
                supports integration with Microsoft Active Directory Federations Services (ADFS)
                or any SAML 2.0 - compatible IdPs with AWS 
                Access to AWS Console, CLI and AWS API 
                    using temporary credentials
                    need to setup trust btw AWS IAM and SAML 2.0 Identity provider (both ways)
                uses STS API (AssumeRoleWithSAML API)
                old way, Amazon SSO Federation is new managed and simpler way
            Custom Identity Broker Application
                use only if Identity provider is not compatible with SAML 2.0
                Identity Broker must define appropriate IAM Role 
                use STS API (AssumeRole or GetFederationToken)
            Web Identity Federation
                Without Cognito 
                    3rd party Identity provider 
                    ex: Amazon, google, facebook etc 
                With Cognito 
                    create IAM Roles using Cognito with least privilege needed 
                    build trust between OIDC IdP and AWS 
                    3rd party <=> Cognito <=> STS 
                    supports anonymous users 
                    supports MFA

                establish trust connections with on-prem AD (if u have)
                    must establish Direct Connect (DX) or VPN connection
                    three kinds of forest trust

                        on-prem=>AWS 
                        aws<=>on-prem 
                    forest trust is different than synchronization (replication is not supported)
                if u want replication
                    create replica of ur AD in EC2

        SSM Parameter Store vs AWS Secrets Manager
            Secret Manager 
                $$$
                automatic rotation of secrets with AWS Lambda
                KMS encryption is Mandatory
                can integrate with CloudFormation 
            SSM Parameter Store
                $
                simple API 
                No secret rotation (can enable rotation using Lambda triggered by EventBridge)
                KMS encryption is optional
                can integrate with CloudFormation 
                can pull Secrets Manager secret using SSM Parameter Store API 
        RDS Security
            KMS encryption at rest for underlying EBS volumes/snapshots 
            Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for Oracle and SQL Server 
            SSL encryption to RDS is possible for all DB 
            IAM authentication for MySQL, PostgreSQL and MariaDB 
            Authorization still happens at RDS level (not IAM)
            can copy un-encrypted RDS snapshot to encrypted one 
            CloudTrail can't be used to track queries made with RDS 
        SSL/TLS 
            Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) used to encrypt connections 
            Transport Layer Security (TLS) is newer version 
            nowadays, TLS certificates are mainly used, people still asume them as SSL 
            Server Name Indication (SNI)
                solves problem of loading multiple SSL certificates onto one web server(to server multiple websites)
                it's a newer protocol and requires the client to indicate the hostname of target 
                server in initial SSL handshake 
                server will then find correct certificate or return default one.
                Only works for ALB & NLB, CloudFront. 
                Doesn't work for CLB (classic load balancer)

            Certificate renewal 
                Automatically done if generated provisioned by ACM 
                any manually uploaded certs must be renewed manually and re-uploaded 
            ACM is a regional service 
                u need to issue a SSL cert in each region where ur application deployed 
                u can't copy certs accross regions

        Questions 
            An EC2 instance in a public subnet is trying to access an Amazon S3 bucket. 
            This EC2 instance often starts and stops. You would like to restrict access 
            to that EC2 instance only. How can you do it?
                Attach an Elastic IP to the EC2 instance and create an S3 bucket policy with 
                a condition limiting access to the EC2 elastic IP
                since SourceIP doesn't work with private IP 
            You want an easy way to deploy and manage WAF Rules, Security Groups, AWS Shield, .etc. 
            in all those accounts instead of managing them one by one.
                AWS Firewall Manager 
            Which of the following IAM Condition key you can use to restrict access only from a specific AWS Organization?
