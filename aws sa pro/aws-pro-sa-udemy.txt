            long term credentials
        Groups

            IAM Access Advisor 
                see permissions granted and when last accessed 
            IAM Access Analyzer 
                analyze resources that are shared with external entity 
            Types
                AWS Managed
                Customer Managed
                Inline policies 
        Resource Based Policies

            SQS Queues etc
        IAM Roles vs Resource Based Policies
            When u(user,application or service) assume a role, u giveup ur original permissions and 
            take permissions assigned to the role 
            When using a resource based policy, the principal doesn't have to giveup any permissions
        IAM Permission Boundaries
            supported for users and roles (not groups)
            allows u to set max permissions an IAM entity can get 
        IAM Access Analyzer
            to find which resources are shared externally
            define Zone of Trust (AWS Acc or AWS Org)
            Access outside zone of trust => findings 
            Policy Validation 
                grammar and best practices 
                security warningg, errors and suggestions 
                actionable recommendations 
            Policy Generation 
                generates policy based on access activity
                CloudTrail logs is reviewed to generate policy with fine-grained permissions and 
                appropriate actions and services 
                reviews CloudTrail logs upto 90 days 
        STS (Security Token Service)
            to assume a role 
            define IAM Role within ur acc or cross-acc 
            define which principals can access this Role 
            Use STS to retrieve credentials and 
            impersonate the IAM Role u have access to (AssumeRole API)            
            temporary credentials can be valid between 15min to 12hrs
            can revoke active sessions and credentials for a role by adding policy 
            using a time statement - AWSRevokeOlderSessions 
            For granting access to 3rd party 
                3rd party AWS Acc ID 
                An External ID (secret btw u and 3rd party)
                    to uniquely associate the role btw u and 3rd party
                    must be provided when difining the trust and when assuming the role 
                    must be choosen by 3rd party
            Session Tags 
                tags that u pass when u assume a role 
                to have condition in policy 
            AssumeRole API
                access a role within ur account or cross-account 
            AssumeRoleWithSAML API 
                return credentials for user logged with SAML 
            AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API 
                return credentials for user logged with IdP
                ex: Amazon Congnito, login with amazon, facebook, goolge or any OpenID Connect 
                AWS recommends to use Cognito Instead
            GetSessionToken API 
                for MFA, from a user or AWS account root user 
            GetFederationToken API 
                obtain temporary credentials for fred user, 
                usually a proxy app that give the creds to distributed app inside a corporate network 
        Identity Federation 
            give users outside of AWS permissions to access AWS resources in ur account 
            from Identity Providers
                SAML 2.0 
                Custom Identity Broker 
                Web Identity Federation with(out) AWS Cognito
                Single Sign-On (SSO)
            SAML 2.0 Federation
                Security Assertion Markup language 2.0 
                supports integration with Microsoft Active Directory Federations Services (ADFS)
                or any SAML 2.0 - compatible IdPs with AWS 
                Access to AWS Console, CLI and AWS API 
                    using temporary credentials
                    need to setup trust btw AWS IAM and SAML 2.0 Identity provider (both ways)
                uses STS API (AssumeRoleWithSAML API)
                old way, Amazon SSO Federation is new managed and simpler way
            Custom Identity Broker Application
                use only if Identity provider is not compatible with SAML 2.0
                Identity Broker must define appropriate IAM Role 
                use STS API (AssumeRole or GetFederationToken)
            Web Identity Federation
                Without Cognito 
                    3rd party Identity provider 
                    ex: Amazon, google, facebook etc 
                With Cognito 
                    create IAM Roles using Cognito with least privilege needed 
                    build trust between OIDC IdP and AWS 
                    3rd party <=> Cognito <=> STS 
                    supports anonymous users 
                    supports MFA 
                    data synchronization 
        ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services)
            SSO accross applications
            SAML accross 3rd party 
        AWS Directory Services 
            AWS Managed Microsoft AD 
                create ur own AD in AWS 
                manage users locally 
                supports MFA 
                establish trust connections with on-prem AD (if u have)
                    must establish Direct Connect (DX) or VPN connection
                    three kinds of forest trust 
                        aws=>on-prem
                        on-prem=>AWS 
                        aws<=>on-prem 
                    forest trust is different than synchronization (replication is not supported)
                if u want replication
                    create replica of ur AD in EC2 
                    establish trust btw AWS Managed Microsoft AD and EC2                     
            AD Connector 
                Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on-prem AD 
                supports MFA 
                users are managed only on on-prem AD 
                no caching capability 
                no trust setup 
                must have VPN or Direct Connect (DX)   
                doesn't work with SQL Server, doesn;t do seamless joining, can't share directory             
            Simple AD 
                AD-compatible managed directory on AWS 
                cannot be joined with on-prem AD 
                supports joining EC2 instances, manage users and groups 
                doesn't support MFA, RDS, SQL Server, AWS SSO 
                small:500,large:5000 users 
                no trust relationship 
        AWS Organizations 
            OrganizationAccountAccessRole 
                Automatically added to all new member accounts created with AWS Organizations
                grants full admin permissions in the member account to management account
                used to perform admin tasks in member accounts 
                can be assumed by IAM users in Management account 
                must create manually if you invite an existing member account 
            Feature Modes
                Consolidated billing features 
                    single payment method
                    pricing benefits from aggregated usage 
                All Features (Default):
                    includes consolidated billing features and SCP (Service Control Policies)
                    Invited accounts must approve enabling all features 
                    can apply SCP to prevent member accounts from leaving the org 
                    can't go back to Consolidated Billing Features only 
            Reserved Instances 
                for billing purposes, consolidated billing feature treats all accounts in org as one account 
                payer account (management account) of an org can turn off Reserved Instance discount and Savings Plans
                discount sharing for any accounts in that org including the payer account.
            Moving Accounts 
                moving to new org 
                remove the member account from old org 
                send an invite to member account from new org 
                accept invite to new org from member account
