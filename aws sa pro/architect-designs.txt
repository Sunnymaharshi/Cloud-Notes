CloudFront – Restrict Access to Application Load Balancers and Custom Origins
    Prevent direct access to your ALB or Custom Origins (only access through CloudFront)
    First, configure CloudFront to add a Custom HTTP Header to requests it sends to the ALB

    Keep the custom header name and value secret!
