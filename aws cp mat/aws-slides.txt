	EC2 user data (bootstraping)
		launching commands when machine starts
		run only once at the instance first start
	Instance Types
		General purpose instances
			provide a balance of compute, memory, 
			and networking resources, and can be used for a wide range of workloads.
		Compute optimized instances
			Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications
			that benefit from high-performance processors.
		Memory optimized instances
			Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance 
			for workloads that process large data sets in memory.
			best for databases, processing big unstructured data.
		Storage optimized instances
			Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads 
			that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.
			They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, 
			random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications.
			best for databases, online transaction processing.
	Security groups
		firewall on ec2 instances
		access to ports
		only allow rules
	Pricing
		pay per second, min duration is 1 minute
		On-Demand
			without any upfront payment or long-term commitment

		Dedicated Instances
			run in a VPC on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer.
		Capacity Reservations
			reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration.
