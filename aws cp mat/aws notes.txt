aws overview
	6 advantages of cloud computing
		Trade fixed expense for variable expense
		Benefit from massive economies of scale 
		Stop guessing capacity 
		Increase speed and agility 
		Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
		Go global in minutes
		
	Global infrastructure
		AWS Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple Availability Zones.
		Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers.
		AWS Local Zones 
			place compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer to end-users.
			AWS Local Zones, you can easily run highly-demanding applications that require single-digit
			millisecond latencies to your end-users such as media & entertainment content creation,		
			real-time gaming, reservoir simulations, electronic design automation, and machine learning.
		AWS Wavelength 
			enables developers to build applications that deliver single-digit millisecond 
			latencies to mobile devices and end-users.
			5G networks.
			single-digit millisecond latencies such as game and live video streaming, machine learning 				inference at the edge, and augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR).
			Application traffic can reach application servers running in Wavelength Zones without leaving 				the mobile providerâ€™s network.
		AWS Outposts 
			bring native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, 				co-location space, or on-premises facility.
			designed for connected environments and can be used to support workloads that need to remain
			on-premises due to low latency or local data processing needs.

	AWS Well-Architected Framework
		Operational Excellence Pillar
			The operational excellence pillar includes how your organization supports your business
			objectives, your ability to run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and
			to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.
			Design Principles:
				Perform operations as code
				Make frequent, small, reversible changes
				Refine operations procedures frequently
				Anticipate failure
				Learn from all operational failures
		Security Pillar
			The security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and 				integrity of data, managing user permissions, and establishing controls to detect security events.
			Design Principles:
				Implement a strong identity foundation
				Enable traceability
				Apply security at all layers
				Automate security best practices
				Protect data in transit and at rest
				Keep people away from data
				Prepare for security events
		Reliability Pillar
			The reliability pillar focuses on workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover 				quickly from failure to meet demands. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, 				and adapting to changing requirements.
			Design Principles:
				Automatically recover from failure
				Test recovery procedures
				Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
				Stop guessing capacity
				Manage change in automation
		Performance Efficiency Pillar
			The performance efficiency pillar focuses on structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing 				resources.
			The performance efficiency pillar focuses on the efficient use of computing resources to meet 				requirements, and how to maintain efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
			Design Principles:
				Democratize advanced technologies
				    Make advanced technology implementation easier for your team
				Go global in minutes
				Use serverless architectures
				Experiment more often
				Consider mechanical sympathy
		Cost Optimization Pillar
			The cost optimization pillar focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs.
			Design Principles:
				Practice Cloud Financial Management
				Expenditure and usage awareness
				Cost-effective resources
				Manage demand and supplying resources
				Optimize over time
			Sustainability Pillar
				The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud 					workloads.
				Design principles:
					Understand your impact
					Establish sustainability goals
					Maximize utilization
					Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offering
					Use managed services
					Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
