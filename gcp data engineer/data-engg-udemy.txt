Cloud Storage
	Cloud Storage Transfer
		move data from
			on-premise
			other clouds
		btw buckets
		one-time or recurring
		on-premise transfer
			< 1TB gsutil
			> 1TB cloud storage transfer service
	Transfer Appliance
		100TB
		480TB
	Access controls
		Uniform bucket level access
			recommended
			uses cloud Identity and IAM
			to bucket or to objects with common prefix
		Fine-grained
			legacy
			uses ACLs
			applies to both bucket and objects
		Signed URLs
			time-limited read or write ops on object
			allows access to those without IAM authorizations
		Signed Policy documents
			specify what can be uploaded
			size
			type
			and other
	Life cycle policies
		actions
			change storage class
			delete object based on date
			purge no of versions
		conditions
			age
			created before
			is live
			matched storage class
			no of new versions

Relational Databases
	Cloud SQL
		multi-regional - for backups only
		upto 30TB per database
		postgresql,mysql and sql server
		connect through
			public ip
			private ip
			Cloud SQL Auth proxy
		Cloud SQL Auth proxy
			supports public and private endpoints
			validates connections using credentials for service acc or user
			implements SSL/TLS layer for connections
			proxy client and proxy server
	Cloud Spanner
		global
		upto 2TB per node
		horizontal scalable
		auto replication
		no planned downtime
		hot spotting
			read/write on same node
			can happen if we use sequential primary keys
				auto increment 
				timestamps
			use
				hash value of primary
				bit-reverse sequential values
				promote high-cardinality attributes in multi-attribute primary key
		interleaved tables
			parent-child relationship
				person to addresses
			row from parent table stored with rows from child table
			more efficient when retrieving data from both
	Cloud Firestore
		NoSQL Databases
		document model
			key-value pairs
			hierarchical
		modes
			datastore mode
				server based
			native mode
				mobile or web
				large no of connections
		Index
			required for all queries
			single field
				automatically created
			composite
				multiple fields
				not automatically created
				manually created
		namespace is group of kinds
		kind is group of similar entities 
		entity is set of properties
	BigTable
		build on sparse multi-D array
		petabyte scale data
		low-latency writes
		key-based reads
		analytics
		Time series applications
			IoT
			Finance
			Monitoring
		no of nodes
		SSD or HDD
		Region/Zone
		Scales linearly
		Multi-region high availability with cluster replication
		Hbase API
		Row Key
			unique identifier for a row
			not support joins
			used to find where data is written
			Within nodes there are multiple storted-string tables (SSTables)
			Data is sharded into blocks of continuous row called tablets
			Tablets are stored in Colossus file system
			Data not stored in nodes
			only metadata stored in nodes
			Data stored in Colossus
			row key determines node and SSTable where data is written
			Avoid
				linearly incremented row keys
				low cardinality attributes
			Design
				high to low cardinality
				sensor id + reverse datetime
		Denormalization
			Each table has one index based on row key
			Rows are sorted by row-key
			columns are grouped into families
			all operations are atomic at row level
			related entities should be sorted in adjacent row to improve read perf
			empty colomn do not take any space
		Column Families
			set of related columns in a table
			upto 100 column families
		1000 Tables per instance
		Better to store in 1 table than many
	
	Big Query
		serverless
		analytical
		BigQuery ML
		BigQuery BI Engine
		BigQuery GIS

ETL
	cloud composer
		apache airflow service
		DAGs
	Data fusion
		CDAP analytics platform
		code free ETL
	Cloud Data flow
		stream and batch processing
		apache beam runner
		horizontal scalable
		used for ETL
		supports windowing operations		
	Cloud Dataproc
		Spark and hadoop service
		large-scale batch processing and machine learning
		supports stream processing
		ephemeral clusters
		cloud storage connector
			open source java library
			allows to use cloud storage instead of HDFS attached storage
ML
	Unsupervised learning
		detect unknown patterns
		clustering
		anomoly detection
		principal component analysis
	supervised		
	reinforcement
		learn from environment
		maximize reward
	Symbolic machine learning
		modeled using symbols
	neural networks and deep learning
