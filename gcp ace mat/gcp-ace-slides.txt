Notes:
	Connecting to Google Cloud:
		Cloud VPN
			encrypt traffic
			lower throughput solution
			upto 3Gbps
			site-to-site
			Types:
				Classic VPN
					do not support IPv6.
					SLA of 99.9%
					static routes
					
					
				HA VPN (high-availability)
					IPsec VPN connection
					SLA of 99.99%
					
		Cloud Interconnect
			enterprise-grade connection
			higher throughput
			access to internal IPs
			dedicated connection(Dedicated Interconnect) - 10-100Gbps
				Connection in Colocation facility
			or use a service provider (Partner Interconnect) - 50Mbps to 10Gbps
	Connecting to Google Workspace and Google APIs:
		routed using BGP
		access to Public IPs
		Direct Peering
			direct peering connection between your business network and Google's edge network 
			exchange high-throughput cloud traffic
		Carrier Peering	
			access Google applications, such as Google Workspace,
			using a service provider to obtain enterprise-grade network services
			
			
	Choosing a network Connection Option
		Interconnect
			Direct access to internal IPs in your VPC with SLA
			Dedicated Interconnect
			Partner Interconnect
			CLoud VPN
		Peering
			Access to Google public IPs only 
			without SLA
			Direct Peering
			Carrier Peering	
	
	Shared VPC
		diff projects withing org
		Centralised Administration
		host project and service projects
	VPC Peering
		across org or within project
		Decentralised Administration
	Load Balancers
		Global
			HTTP(S)
				SSL session terminates at LB
				layer 7
				Cloud CDN
					caches
					for low latency and decrease egress cost
			SSL Proxy
				layer 4
				encrypted, non-http traffic
			TCP Proxy
				layer 4
				unencrypted non-http traffic
				
		Regional
			Internal TCP/UDP
			Network TCP/UDP
				non proxied
			Internal HTTP(S)

		serverless
		Batch and stream processing
		automatic
	Cloud Dataproc
		Apache Spark and Hadoop clusters
		Manual
	Cloud Dataprep 
		serverless
		explore, clean and prepare data
		for analysis and ML
		Trifacta partner service
		
	Google Kubernetes Engine GKE
		nodes - VMs
		services deployed into pods
	Cloud Run
		serverless
		stateless apps
		deploy docker containers
	App Engine
		microservices
		1 app per project
		1 or more services with versions
		traffic splitting
		
	Cloud Functions
		serverless
		loosely coupled
		event driven microservices
		Triggers
			changes in storage buckets

	Key Performance indicators KPIs
		metrics used to measure success
		SLI
			measurable attribute of service
		SLO
			goal u want to achieve for SLI
		SLA
			binding contract
			compensation if service doesn't meet expectations
			more restrictive version of SLO
	Microservices
		12 factors
	APIs managing
		Apigee API Platform
		Cloud Endpoints
	Binary authorization
		deploy only trusted containers into GKE
		
	Cloud Storage Transfer Service
		smaller or scheduled data uploads
		S3,HTTP(S),Cloud storage buckets
		scheduled jobs
		100s of TBs
	Transfer Appliance
		large data
		upto 1PB shipped to google
	Disaster Recovery
		Cold Standby
			snapshots,images and backups in multi region
			if failure occurs, spin up servers in backup region
		Hot Standby
			create instances in multiple regions
			store in multi-regions
			spanner or firestore
	Identity Aware Proxy (IAP)
		less time than to implement VPN
		simplifies auth to google apps and VMs
		Control access to your cloud-based and on-premises applications and VMs running on Google Cloud
		Work from untrusted networks without the use of a VPN
		HTTP(S) LB
		GKE, APP Engine
		access web based apps without VPN
	Cloud Armor
		layer 7
		Web App firewall (WAF) rules
		to create network security policies
		allow and deny lists of IPs or ranges
	Server-side Encryption

		cloud storage
		Big Query
		Firestore
	Rolling Updates
		if it is ok to run 2 versions simul
		update each instance at a time
	blue/green deployment
		Blue - current ver
		green - new ver
		don't want to run multiple versions simul
	Canary releases
		deploy at some part
		monitor for errors
	Monitoring
