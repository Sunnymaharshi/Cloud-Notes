	Use Cloud SQL for MySQL external replica.

Your company is shutting down their data center and migrating several MySQL and PostgreSQL databases to Google Cloud. Your database operations team is severely constrained by ongoing production releases and the lack of capacity for additional on-premises backups. You want to ensure that the scheduled migrations happen with minimal downtime and that the Google Cloud databases stay in sync with the on-premises data changes until the applications can cut over. What should you do?
	Use Database Migration Service to migrate the databases to Cloud SQL.
	Use replication from an external server to migrate the databases to Cloud SQL.

Your company is migrating the existing infrastructure for a highly transactional application to Google Cloud. You have several databases in a MySQL database instance and need to decide how to transfer the data to Cloud SQL. You need to minimize the downtime for the migration of your 500 GB instance. What should you do?
	1. Create migration job using Database Migration Service.
	2. Set the migration job type to Continuous, and allow the databases to complete the full dump phase and start
	sending data in change data capture (CDC) mode.
	3. Wait for the replication delay to minimize, initiate a promotion of the new Cloud SQL instance, and wait for the
	migration job to complete.
	4. Update your application connections to the new instance. 

You are starting a large CSV import into a Cloud SQL for MySQL instance that has many open connections. You checked memory and CPU usage, and sufficient resources are available. You want to follow Google-recommended practices to ensure that the import will not time out. 
	Close idle connections or restart the instance before beginning the import operation.
